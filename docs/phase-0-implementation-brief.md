## 2. Risk Assessment

### 2.1 High-Priority Risks

| Risk                          | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **React Flow Performance**    | High   | Medium      | Implement 120ms render budget with 100-node performance testing |
| **Supabase Rate Limits**      | High   | Medium      | Implement proper rate limiting (100 req/min) with user feedback |
| **FSRS Algorithm Complexity** | Medium | Medium      | Use proven FSRS implementation with comprehensive unit tests    |
| **Accessibility Compliance**  | High   | Low         | Automated Axe testing + manual keyboard navigation audits       |

### 2.2 Medium-Priority Risks

| Risk                           | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Media Storage Costs**        | Medium | Medium      | Implement file size caps (5MB images, 50MB video) with compression |
| **Email Delivery Reliability** | Medium | Low         | Use Postmark with fallback notifications                           |
| **Browser Compatibility**      | Medium | Low         | Support Chrome 114+, Firefox 113+, Safari 16+ with CI testing      |
| **Data Migration Complexity**  | Medium | Low         | Implement proper DB migrations with rollback capability            |

### 2.3 Low-Priority Risks

- **Third-party dependency updates** - Managed through automated dependency scanning
- **Backup restore procedures** - Monthly drill process established
- **Legal compliance** - Privacy/Terms stubs to be replaced before launch

## 3. Open Questions Requiring Clarification

### 3.1 Technical Decisions

1. **Media File Size Limits**: Current placeholder is 20MB - needs confirmation based on storage billing model
2. **Badge Artwork Source**: Custom design vs icon library approach - affects timeline and budget
3. **Email Notification Granularity**: Additional toggles beyond current spec (e.g., badge earned notifications)
4. **Offline Capability Priority**: PDF export vs full offline packages - impacts development complexity

### 3.2 Business Logic Clarifications

1. **Prerequisite Enforcement**: Confirm "exactly-all inbound prerequisites required" rule for complex dependency chains
2. **Assessment Retries**: Unlimited retries confirmed for formative assessment approach
3. **Data Retention**: 4-year inactive account purge policy needs legal review
4. **User Roles**: Instructor vs Tutor distinction and permission levels

### 3.3 Integration Points

1. **Google OAuth Scope**: Confirmed as 'profile email openid' - no additional permissions needed
2. **Supabase Project**: Existing project `mupsfsdbeiqfezliapyn` confirmed for development
3. **Domain Setup**: `app.paramindlms.com` availability and DNS configuration
