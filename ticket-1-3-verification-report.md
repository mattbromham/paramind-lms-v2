### 2. Implementation Verification ✅

#### 2.1 AuthProvider Component

- ✅ **Location**: `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`
- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Uses `SessionContextProvider` properly
- ✅ **Export**: Re-exports `useSession` for convenience
- ✅ **SSR Safety**: Uses `getSupabase()` client factory

#### 2.2 Main App Integration

- ✅ **Wrapper**: App properly wrapped in `<AuthProvider>` in `main.tsx`
- ✅ **Client Init**: Supabase client initialized correctly
- ✅ **React Structure**: Proper React.StrictMode usage

#### 2.3 AuthButton Component

- ✅ **Conditional Rendering**: Shows "Sign in" when logged out, "Sign out" + email when logged in
- ✅ **Brand Styling**: Uses `bg-pm-primary` class as specified
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-haspopup`)
- ✅ **State Management**: Integrates SignInDialog state properly

#### 2.4 SignInDialog Component

- ✅ **UI Framework**: Uses shadcn/ui Dialog primitives
- ✅ **Auth Integration**: Embeds Supabase Auth component with ThemeSupa
- ✅ **OAuth Support**: Configures Google OAuth provider
- ✅ **UX Flow**: Auto-closes on successful sign-in with toast notification
- ✅ **Styling**: Brand-consistent styling with custom appearance

#### 2.5 App Integration

- ✅ **Header Integration**: AuthButton properly placed in app header
- ✅ **Toast System**: Sonner toaster configured for notifications
- ✅ **Layout**: Responsive design with proper spacing

### 3. Security Implementation ✅

- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Proper validation of required Supabase credentials
- ✅ **Client Factory**: SSR-safe client creation with browser singleton pattern
- ✅ **Session Management**: Leverages Supabase's secure session handling
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Throws early on missing environment variables

### 4. Testing Quality ✅

- ✅ **Mock Strategy**: Proper mocking of external dependencies
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: All critical paths tested
- ✅ **Snapshot Testing**: Component output snapshots for regression detection
- ✅ **Async Testing**: Proper async/await patterns in tests

## Environment & Live Testing ✅
